3. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env` file in the client directory:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

4. **Start the frontend development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## AI Recommendation Algorithms

### 1. Content-Based Filtering
- Analyzes product features (category, manufacturer, price range)
- Recommends products similar to user's liked items
- Uses product metadata and user preferences

### 2. Collaborative Filtering
- Uses Jaccard similarity to find users with similar tastes
- Recommends products liked by similar users
- Implements user-based collaborative filtering

### 3. Hybrid Approach
- Combines content-based and collaborative filtering
- Weights different recommendation types for optimal results
- Provides diverse and accurate recommendations

### 4. Personalized Recommendations
- Analyzes complete user interaction history
- Weights different interaction types (purchases > likes > views)
- Calculates category and manufacturer preferences

## Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Run Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Authentication tests
npm test auth.test.js

# Recommendation engine tests
npm test recommendations.test.js
```

### Test Coverage
- Authentication flow (registration, login, token validation)
- Product CRUD operations
- Recommendation algorithms accuracy
- API endpoint functionality
- User interaction tracking
